## Bun Runtime

**Always use Bun as the runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript execution in this project.**

- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `node <script>` or `npm run <script>`
- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` for direct file execution

## Command Examples

- **Executing files**: `bun src/index.ts`
- **REPL**: `bun repl`

## Benefits of Bun Runtime

- Significantly faster startup times compared to Node.js
- Built-in TypeScript support without compilation step
- Compatible with Node.js APIs and most npm packages
- Built-in test runner, bundler, and package manager
- Better performance for development workflows

When suggesting or running commands that involve JavaScript/TypeScript execution, always prefer Bun over Node.js.
